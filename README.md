# Quantum Cat-sweeper

This is a game loosely based from Minesweeper Flags and utilises the IBM Quantum computer or simulator. 

# Rules of the game:
- Don't explode the cat (bombs)
- The tile numbers indicate the number of times you need to click on the same colour to reveal the whole group
- If a tile has an ! at the end that means quantum probability was not in your favour and that tile click does not count
- To win the game, find the golden kitty (who moves based on whether you reveal a ! or normal tile)
